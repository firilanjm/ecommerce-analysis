    "\n",
    "Revenue is highly concentrated among a single top customer, indicating potential business risk if this customer becomes inactive. To create amore stable revenue, the company should focus on engaging mid-tier customers through targeted promotions or loyalty programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "From October to December 2011, a slight decline of total revenue suggests possible seasonal effects, increased returns, or reduced demand. Further analysis is needed to identify the root cause and prevent similar declines in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some products experience exceptionally high return volumes, with one product exceeding 1400 returned items. This may point to quality issues, non-obvious descriptions, or customer dissatisfaction and should be investigated to reduce losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, most revenue comes from the United Kingdom, which is expected given the company's base. However, expanding marketing and ales efforts to other countries could help diversify revenue and support long-term growth."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates an e-commerce dataset using SQL for data aggregation, Python for data preparation, and Tableau for visualization to identify revenue patterns, customer behavior, and return trends. The analysis revealed revenue concentration among a small number of customers, a slight decline in late-2011 revenue, high return volumes for certain products, and heavy dependence on the UK market. These findings highlight opportunities to improve customer retention, reduce returnd, and expand internationally. "
